When your legs don't work like they used to beforeAnd I can't sweep you off of your feetWill your mouth still remember the taste of my love?Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?And darling I will be loving you till we're seventyAnd baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-threeAnd I'm thinking about how
